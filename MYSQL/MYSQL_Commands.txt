VALUES (1, 'BioShock', 'You are playing as the silent protagonist Jack. The game opens with Jack on a plane flying over the Atlantic in the year 1960. Naturally the plane crashes, and Jack finds himself in the middle of the Atlantic, the only survivor of the crash. \"Coincidentally\" enough, a towering lighthouse is on a small platform in front of Jack. Upon entering, Jack is met with a daunting statue of a man named Andrew Ryan. A banner across the statute reads \"No Gods or Kings, Only Man\". Andrew Ryan is the creator of Rapture, and under water city that Jack now finds himself in. 
After riding a bathysphere to the entrance of the city, it becomes obvious that this is not the kind of place Jack should be wandering around in. It is populated by drugged up psychos, called splicers, who will kill pretty much anyone on sight. Their drug of choice is called ADAM. ADAM is the substance that runs Rapture. It alters one\'s genetic code, allowing them to look different, gain special abilities etc. Jack finds a service radio in the Bathysphere, which a man named Atlas communicates to him through. Atlas informs Jack that Andrew Ryan is a monster who must be stopped. Ryan took Atlas\'s family, and Atlas needs Jack to help him get them back. Naturally he will help Jack escape this condemned city if he helps him. To remain strong, Jack must too harvest ADAM, in order to be able to fight through the city. ADAM is gained by either saving small mutated girls called \"Little Sisters\", or killing them. Dr. Tenenbaum, the genius who invented these girls pleads with Jack to save them instead of harvesting them, as they are just regular little girls whose lives she ruined. Now she hopes for redemption by saving them. That choice is left up to the player, and alters how the ending plays out. Jack and Atlas nearly meet at the submarine that Atlas’s family is hiding in, however at the last second Ryan has the area destroyed, killing Atlas\'s family, and keeping Jack and Atlas separated. Enraged, Atlas asks Jack to kill Andrew Ryan. After ridiculous amounts of battling through Ryan\'s army of splicers, Jack finally makes it to Ryan\'s office, where he finds him casually putting a golf ball. Ryan reveals to Jack that he is in fact his illegitimate son. He was born in Rapture only 4 years prior, and his embryo had been purchased by Ryan’s main rival and enemy, Frank Fontaine. Frank Fontaine had been vying to overthrow Ryan for some time, and their clashing had led to the civil war and ultimate fall of Rapture. Fontaine altered Jack\'s memory, and genetically modified him to have a trigger phrase of \"Would you kindly\". If an order was given to Jack that either began or ended with this phrase, he would obey it no matter what. Fontaine sent Jack to the surface, and ordered him to hijack the plane. Jack is only back in Rapture because he is Frank Fontaine\'s puppet. Ryan drives this point home, when he says to Jack: \"Would you kindly bash my head in with this golf club\". The player watches in horror as this gruesome act plays out before them. At this point Frank Fontaine reveals himself to be Jack\'s supposed ally Atlas. The player realizes at this point that everything in the game prior has happened because they were under the control of Fontaine who has used the phrase in literally all of their talks. Dr Tenenbaum helps Jack escape the office and disables the trigger phrase from his brain. Jack corners Frank Fontaine who, in a moment of desperation takes vast amounts of ADAM, turning himself into an incredibly powerful foe. However with the help of Tenenbaum\'s little sisters, Jack subdues him, and ultimately kills him. The ending varies based on how the player chose to interact with the Little Sisters. If he saved these little girls lives, he is seen riding back to the surface, raising the girls with care, and living out a long and happy life as their caretaker. If he kills them for their ADAM, he then is seen killing all of the Little Sister\'s who helped him defeat Fontaine. Jack is seen with a gang of splicers taking over a submarine passing through the plane\'s wreckage, and it is ultimately implied that due to his actions Rapture\'s insanity has now found a way to reach the outer world.');

VALUES (1, 'FightClub', 'A nameless first person Narrator opens the movie with a gun being held in his mouth by a man named Tyler Durden. However he decides that its best if the story starts from the beginning. The narrator explains that he is an insomniac. He is seen working his dead end, boring, desk job, and having many a sleepless night. Frustrated and in pain, he decides to attempt to get sleeping medication from the doctor. The doctor declines, and jokes to him that if he wants to see real pain he should go to the testicular cancer survivor support group. Whether the doctor was kidding or not, the narrator decides to actually go. There, \"something beautiful happens\". The narrator lets go, and cries along with the survivors. That night, he sleeps like a baby. He becomes addicted to these support groups, and goes to the every night. The release he feels there relieves his insomnia. However, he notices a woman, Marla Singer, who is also an imposter on these groups. Her presence ruins the groups for him. He finally confronts her, and they agree to split up the groups. After this scene, we find the narrator on a plane next to an interesting character, that we recognize as Tyler Durden. The duo get to talking, and it becomes clear the Tyler has an unorthodox way of thinking, to say the least. He leaves his seat, and the movie cuts to the airport. The narrator has lost his luggage, due to concern that it was a bomb. Exasperated, he sees Tyler speeding off in a flashy red sports car. When the narrator arrives at his apartment, he finds that it has exploded. Having no where else to turn, the narrator calls Tyler and asks him to go to the bar with him. While drinking and chatting, Tyler reveals a central idea of his, and the movie as a whole. \"The things you own, end up owning you.\" With this mantra the narrator is able to let go of all the losses he suffered that day, noting that it is \"just stuff\". After much more drinking, the narrator finally sums up the courage to ask Tyler to crash at his place. Tyler agrees, but first wants the narrator to do something crazy for him. He asks the narrator to hit him. They fight, and go back to Tyler\'s house. It is a decrepit old house in an abandoned area. The two hit it off, and spend many nights drinking and fighting each other. Soon other bar goers want to fight as well. Thus begins fight club. Fight club quickly becomes the only important thing to both the narrator and Tyler. It moves to the bars basement, and grows daily. One evening Marla Singer calls the narrator, after having apparently attempted suicide. The narrator dismisses her, but Tyler does not. The two grow a very dysfunctional relationship, to the narrators disdain. Being right in the middle of their shenanigans, the narrator is told by Tyler to never bring him up to Marla. The narrator agrees, visibly frustrated with the situation. Soon enough, it becomes fairly clear that Fight Club is evolving. The narrator fabricates an assault on him, by his manager, and is granted full pay for working at home. He is now capable to fully focus on Fight Club all the time. In the mean time, Tyler has begun constructing living quarters in the house. The narrator is unaware of what this is for, until \"recruits\" start appearing at the house. The recruits are for what Tyler has titled \"Project Mayhem\"., the evolution of Fight Club. Tyler has essentially created an army, who terrorize the city with various pranks and crimes. All of the crimes are in line with Tyler’s anti-materialistic viewpoints that we were introduced to early in the film. The narrator and Tyler have a sort of falling out. Tyler tells the narrator to forget everything he knows about Fight Club, and their relationship. After this Tyler disappears. The narrator sleuths through Tyler\'s belongings, and finds that he has been using the narrator\'s assets from work to fly all around the country. The narrator follows these bread crumbs, and finds other, highly disciplined cells of Project Mayhem all around the country. None will reveal any knowledge of Tyler\’s where abouts, until one man reveals quite a bit more. He calls the narrator Tyler Durden. The movie cuts to the narrator waking in his hotel room, clearly dazed and confused, to find Tyler waiting for him. He asks why people think he is Tyler. Tyler says he thinks the narrator knows why. As a montage of the narrator doing everything he always thought he saw Tyler doing flashes across the screen, he says \"because I am you\". \"Bingo\". The narrator returns home and attempts to fully grasp the plan Tyler has for project mayhem. It turns out he has planned to blow up the buildings for every major credit card company in the city. There are many of these. He contacts Marla Singer, as he is now sure that in his \"Tyler\" state, he ordered her to be taken care of because she knew too much. He makes sure she flees the city. Obviously she is confused, as the narrator seems to have no recollection of their relationship. After he knows Marla is safe, the narrator attempts to turn himself in, and stop the whole terrorist plot. However, he soon learns of the extent that Project Mayhem has spread. The officers he turns himself into are part of it, and are going to go through with his orders to \"take the balls\" of anyone who tried to ruin the plot. The narrator fights back however, and escapes the station. He runs to the nearest targeted building, and attempts to defuse the bombs in them himself. However, his imaginary friend Tyler returns, and knocks him out. The narrator wakes to the scene the movie opened with, on the top floor of a building surrounded by the ones we now know to be filled with bombs. He and Tyler discuss how the narrator created Tyler, and why he needs him. The narrator seems to have changed his mind on what kind of things he subconsciously wants however. Unlike when he created Tyler, he no longer wants to blow up these building or cause mayhem. In a moment of clarity, he realizes that Tyler can\'t be holding a gun or threatening him, because he does not actually exist. The gun appears in the narrator\'s hand. He shoots himself in the head in an attempt to kill both himself and Tyler. Tyler falls to the ground, dead. The narrator, however, is still alive after botching the suicide attempt. He is badly injured though. At this point Marla is dragged into the room by all of the Project Mayhem team, who have arrived to watch the fireworks. The narrator (who let\'s not forget they think is Tyler) orders them to leave her alone, and go wait for him downstairs. He explains to Marla that he has been terrible to her, and that everything is going to be fine now. He takes her hands and says \"You met me at a very strange time in my life\", as they turn to find that the entire block of buildings has started to explode.');

VALUES (3, 'Frozen', 'In Frozen, Elsa, the princess of Arendelle has the magic ability to create snow and ice at will. One night she is playing with her younger sister, Anna, when she accidentally strikes her in the head with a beam of this magic. Their parents take the injured Anna to a troll family, where a troll shaman removes the harmful effects of the magic. To do this though, he must also replace all memories of Anna\’s which involve Elsa\'s magic. Upon return, the King and Queen isolate Elsa, in an attempt to help her control her powers. As a result, Elsa spends most of her time alone, afraid that she will hurt her sister. The King and Queen have to go on a journey by boat, so naturally (this being a Disney movie) their boat crashes and they die. When Elsa comes of age she must be coronated as the Queen of Arendelle. This means that for the first time since Anna\'s accident, the Kingdom will be open to guests. Anna is thrilled by this. Elsa is not. Important guests who arrive are thhe Duke of Wessilton, and Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite Elsa\'s anxiety, the cermony goes well, that is until the after party. At the after party Hans and Anna spontaneously fall in love. Hans proposes to Anna, who accepts. They approach Elsa for her blessing. Since, Elsa is a sane person, she refuses to give her blessing, citing the fact that they can’t be in love because they just met. This bother Anna and the two begin to argue. At the arguments pique, Elsa accidentally uses her magic. Naturally everyone freaks out, so Elsa runs off up a nearby mountain. Anna chases after her, leaving Hans in charge. It is soon discovered that, in her panic, Elsa has set Arendelle into a perpetual winter. Anna, who is obviously poorly equipped for her journey, stop at a local trade shop to get supplies. There she meets an ice dealer, Kristoff, and his reindeer, Sven. The two agree to take her up the mountain, in an attempt to end the eternal winter. After much witty banter and relationship growing, the two arrive. There they meet a snowman named Olaf, who Elsa created. He tags along with them  as well. Anna and Elsa reunite, however Elsa is still concerned about hurting Anna. She tells her to just leave her be. The two argue once more, and Elsa accidentally strikes Anna with her magic once more. This time, however, it is in her heart. Anna, Sven, Olaf and Kristoff rush Anna to the same troll family as earlier, which just happens to be who raised Kristoff. The shaman tells the three that the only way to save a \"frozen heart\" is an act of true love. The group deduce that Anna must have her first kiss with Hans, and head off back towards the kingdom. Meanwhile, Hans and the duke of Wessilton have organized a rescue party for Anna, who has been gone too long. The duke has malintent though. He wants to exploit Arendelle as a trade partner, and doesn\'t care about the kingdom at all. He tells the guards he sends on the mission to kill Elsa. When the rescue arrives, Hans stops the duke\'s men from killing Elsa and takes her back to Arendelle as a prisoner. Anna arrives at the castle just in time, and her and Hans are left in peace for their moment. Their moment, however, is Hans revealing to Anna that he never loved her at all, and that he was ALSO just exploiting Arendelle. He had too many older brothers in the Southern Isles, to ever be king. Therefore his plan was to wed Anna, then kill both her and Elsa secretly and take control. Hans does not kiss her, and leaves her to die. He tells all those waiting that Anna has died, and that Elsa killed her. He declares Elsa must be put to death. Olaf finds Anna on her last leg, and they decide that she needs to actually get her true love\'s first kiss from Kristoff. They rush out on the frozen lake outside the castle to find him. Meanwhile, Elsa has broken out of prison, and is also running across the frozen lake, with Hans in pursuit. Hans catches up to Elsa, and tells her she killed her sister. Elsa is devastated, and does not attempt to stop Hans from killing her. Anna however, while attempting to meet up with Kristoff, sees Hans about to kill Elsa a short distance away. She throws herself in front of Elsa as Hans swings his sword. Anna freezes totally at that exact moment, and the sword breaks. Hans is thrown back. Elsa sobs on her now dead sister while a devastated Kristoff, Sven and Olaf look on. But Anna sacrificing herself for her sister was an act of true love. She slowly unfreezes, as her heart has been thawed by sisterly love. Hans and the duke of Wessilton are exiled from Arendelle, and returned to their countries of origin for punishment. Anna lives happily ever after, dating Kristoff, and with a healthy relationship to her sister Elsa.');

VALUES (4, 'Shaun of the Dead', ' Shaun, the movie\'s protagonist, is in a dead end job in a local electronics shop. He lives with his best friend Ed, and another man named Pete. Pete hates Ed. Naturally this means he and Shaun often butt heads. Shaun\'s girlfriend, Liz, desires more from the couple\'s social life, and relationship as a whole. Liz\'s friends, David and Dianne, don\'t seem to care too much for Shaun either, especially David. Furthermore, Shaun has a very tense relationship with his step father Phillip, but he loves and cares about his mother Barbara. Anyway, that as the setup, one day while returning from work, Shaun runs into an old friend Yvonne. The two chat briefly, before Yvonne asks Shaun what he is doing for Liz today, as it\'s their anniversary. Naturally Shaun has forgotten this, so he scrambles to make a plan. Unfortunately, this goes poorly, and he ends up pitching the idea of going to the Winchester Pub to Liz. This goes over very badly, since this is where the couple, and really everyone they socialize with go literally all the time. Not much for romantic. This prompts Liz to break up with Shaun. Upset, Shaun and Ed go to the Winchester anyhow, and get very drunk. On the walk home they see a man acting very strangely. They assume he is just drunk, which is obviously not the case. When they arrive home Pete informs the duo that a crackhead bit him, and he feels terrible, so they should just shut up and go to bed. They do so. When they wake up, Shaun and Ed notice a girl acting strangely in their backyard. After messing about with her for a minute, it becomes apparent that she is in fact a zombie. Furthermore, the whole town seems to be suddenly in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. They go inside to find that Pete is also a zombie, and determine that they need to leave. Where do they decide to go\? Why, the Winchester of course. The two decide to go pick up Shaun\'s mom. When they arrive in the car they stole from Pete, Phillip has been bitten, and is clearly slowly dying. They take Phillip\’s car and make their way to Liz\'s apartment, to retrieve her and her friends. Reluctantly they bring Phillip along, because Barbara insists. They retrieve Liz, Dianne and Davis from Liz\'s and continue on with their journey. Unfortunately Phillip has died and subsequently zombified in their car. So they must continue on foot. On the way the run into Yvonne, and her group of survivors. They inform her they are going to the Pub, to which she seems justifiably surprised. Wishing eachother luck, the groups part. Shaun and company make it to the over run Pub by pretending to act like zombies, and simply walking through the streets. Shaun distracts the zombies, and the others sneak inside. A short time later, after David has spent most of the time complaining about Shaun\'s idea, Shaun returns, clearly successful. All seems successful. The zombies do not know where they are, and things seem decently safe. However, always the fuck up, Ed turns on a pinball machine which makes a terribly loud noise and gives away their position to the zombies. The bar is slowly overrun, and in the process, David (who it is revealed loves Liz), Dianne, and Barbara are all killed. Shaun, Liz, and an injured Ed make it to the basement. Ed and Shaun have a heartfelt moment, as he will clearly have to be left behind in the now burning bar. After much sadness, Liz and Shaun climb a ladder from the basement, to the main street outside. It appears they don\'t have too much time left themselves, when Yvonne and an army convoy show up. Yvonne came back to find them once she had been rescued by the Army. The movie fades and several months pass. When it fades back in, Liz and Shaun are happily dating, and everyone is trying to get their lives back to normally after the incredibly strange events.

In the vault however, things are relatively ok. Or they appear to be. The player\'s father is a doctor, who one day decides to leave the vault, which is of course not ok. The overseer of the vault, a man who is a tad mad with power, seeks out the player after his father escapes. The player eludes him however, and escapes the vault. The Vault is located in Washington DC, an area which got targeted heavily during the war. And it shows. The player goes on a search for his father, who obviously needs a good reason to have abandoned him. The player discovers that his father is a scientist who is working on \"Project Purity\", which is a large water purifier. If completed, clean water would come to the wasteland. Naturally this would be huge for the survivors. The Player discovers his father is captive in another vault, Vault 108. At 108 the player finds that the overseer in this vault has trapped its inhabitants in a simulation, where he toys with them for his own amusement. The player mercy kills the inhabitants, and rescues his father. Once out, player and father head to project purity. The player helps his father fix up the purifier, and things look like they are going well. However, the Enclave shows up. The Enclave is a faction that claims to be remnants of the old US government. They do not want the purifier to work. They want the irradiated survivors to die off, so that the remaining humanity in the area are pure. Anyway, they show up and try to take over the purifier. The player\'s father martyrs himself to stop them from taking control of the purifier. In doing so however, he also sets back the project because it is too irradiated to function. To solve this the player must go to another vault, Vault 87, to get a tool that can fix this problem. Once the character recovers the tool however, the Enclave capture him and take them to their headquarters, Raven Rock. The President, and leader of the enclave, turns out to be a slightly crazy robot. He requests a meeting with the player. In this meeting, depending on how the player has played the game, there are several options to destroy the president. Regardless, one would most likely deactivate the president here. No matter what, the player escapes Raven Rock. He meets back up with \"The Brotherhood of Steel\", a freedom fighting faction with the same aim as the player character (aka fixing the purifier). As a unit, the player and the brotherhood of steel fight their way to the purifier, reclaiming it from the Enclave.

In the last level of the game, a clever in game mechanic actually reveals that the Princess is running away from Tim. It turns out that Tim is the evil monster that the Princess is evading. At the end she is rescued from him by a knight. If the player completes the game in a certain way, hidden content is revealed. The hidden content hints at many possible meanings of the game. A popular theory is that Tim represents scientists working to develop the atomic bomb (The Princess). This theory seems highly plausible because of the quotes found in the hidden content. Namely \"Now we are all sons of bitches\" which was a direct quote from scientist Kenneth Bainbridge upon successfully detonating an atomic bomb.');

Values(1, 'Walking Dead Season 1', 'Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes is shot in a fight against criminals. He goes into a coma for some period of time. When he wakes up, something is clearly amiss. Cue zombie apocalypse.  Rick discovers his wife and children are missing, so naturally his course of action turns to finding them. Before leaving town, he meets fellow survivor Morgan Jones, and his son Duane, who will obviously become important at some point later. Rick leaves them with a police radio, so they can possibly stay in touch share intel. So now Rick is off to Atlanta. The CDC is rumored to have set up an outpost there, so Rick thinks its the obvious place to look for his family. Rick arrives into Atlanta only to find it entirely over run by \"walkers\", the shows word for zombies. Rick finds himself up shit creek (to put it nicely), and it appears his story may be over rapidly. However, then Glenn Rhee, a very important character, saves him. Glenn takes Rick back to his group, who were looking for supplies for a larger group outside of town. Walkers are infiltrating the stronghold Glenn\'s group has set up, so they have to bounce, but before they do Rick handcuffs Merle Dixon, an incredibly racist, all around prick, to the roof. This was a judgment call on Rick\'s part, and naturally this isn\'t the last its heard of. Glenn takes Rick and his crew take Rick back to their group outside of town, and oh, what do you know, Rick\'s wife Lori and son Carl are with them. What a neat turn of events. However, Shane, Rick\'s former police partner, is with them, and he and Lori are lovers. What a not so neat turn of events. Rick is a good (and kind of stupid) guy, so he wants to go back to Atlanta to get a bag of weapons left there, and also to save Merle. When they get there, they find Merle has sawed off his own hand, and escaped by himself. Which says a lot for what kind of crazy he is. When they get back to camp, Rick and the boys find it is being overrun by walkers. A girl named Andrea (who turns into a major character) loses her sister Amy (who clearly doesn\'t), and Jim (a fairly unimportant character). Rick declares this reason enough to go try his initial idea, the CDC, cause clearly Jim needs help there, and CLEARLY no one would have thought of that during Rick\'s undisclosed amount of time in a coma. On the way there Jim dies of the infection. However the convoy moves on. When they get there, they find Dr. Edwin Jenner. All the other staff has either fled, or killed themselves. As it turns out, Jenner is a little crazy too. Fighting a seemingly incurable disease while watching colleagues die must take a toll. Anyway, due to a CDC failsafe designed to inhibit the spread of dangerous diseases in case of an emergency, the whole facility is about to blow up, and Jenner intends to take them all with him. The reasoning given is sort of just because, why wouldn\'t he. Andrea and Jacqui, members of the group who weren\'t all too important until now, decide to stay and die. However Dale, a soon to be important member of the group, convinces Andrea to keep living. Rick and the \"Don\'t want to die yet\" crew escape through a window they knock out, and turn to watch as the center blows up. But now they are in the dangerous outside, low on supplies, and with no real idea where to go. Cue end of season 1. ')

Values(2, 'Walking Dead Season 1', 'The second season begins with Rick and his group of survivors leaving Atlanta. They decide Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they encounter a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles and as a large horde of walkers approaches, is forced to hide under the vehicles. Carol\'s daughter, Sophia, chased away from the highway by two of the remaining walkers, runs off into the woods. Carl is accidentally shot during a search for the missing girl. The remaining group deals with interpersonal relationships while various searches for Sophia are performed. Otis, a hunter who shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. The remainder of Rick\'s group moves to the farm while Carl recovers. The group tries to co-exist alongside Hershel\'s family, but dangerous secrets and disagreements over leadership cause tensions to rise. Daryl leads the initiative to search for Sophia and becomes close to Carol as a result. Glenn builds a romantic relationship with Hershel\'s daughter Maggie and discovers that Hershel\'s barn is full of walkers, many of whom in life had been Hershel\'s friends and relatives. When Shane forces the walkers out of the barn, and the group opens fire, Sophia appears as one of the undead, and Rick shoots her. The bonds of the group are tested in the aftermath of the showdown at the barn. Carol, in her grief, withdraws, as does Daryl, who claims that the group is \"broken\". Hershel, reacting to what has happened, orders Rick and his group to leave immediately, before disappearing to grieve for his family. Rick and Glenn go searching for Hershel and discover him drinking heavily in a local tavern. After trying to persuade Hershel to return, two other men enter the bar, survivors from another group. They tell Rick that Fort Benning has been overrun, and the two men insist on moving onto Hershel\'s farm, only to be repeatedly turned down by Rick. The situation rapidly turns violent, and there is a brief, bloody gunfight that leaves the two new arrivals dead. The dead men\'s former group quickly finds and opens fire on Rick, Hershel, and Glenn. The noise of the firefight attracts a large horde of walkers, and in their desperation to get away, the other group of survivors leaves Randall, one of their members, behind. Rick cannot stand the thought of leaving him to be killed by walkers, so the three blindfold him and take him to the farm. With the secrecy of the farm possibly compromised, Rick decides to drive Randall into the countryside and abandon him. When a disagreement with Shane botches the plan, Rick decides to bring Randall back for execution instead. Hershel\'s daughter Beth tries to kill herself in order to escape a seemingly hopeless situation. Carol, done with mourning, and with new resolve, does her best to bring Daryl back into the fold. The group deliberates over Randall\'s fate and despite Dale\'s protests, decides to execute him. Carl is found watching Rick as he prepares to execute Randall. Dale is fatally wounded by a walker on the farm, indirectly caused by Carl, who had previously seen the walker stuck in the mud in nearby woods and did not kill it because he did not see the walker as any harm to anyone. Daryl euthanizes Dale as an act of mercy. After Dale\'s funeral, the group decides they need to rediscover their humanity. They conduct a search for Randall, whom Shane had secretly released and killed nearby. Daryl and Glenn, who discover that Randall died of a broken neck and was not bitten or scratched by walkers, come to the realization that the dead can reanimate without having previous exposure to the walkers. Shane uses the search for Randall as a plot to silence Rick, but the plan backfires, and Rick is faced with killing Shane. After Shane dies, he reanimates, and Carl shoots him in the head. The gunshot attracts a large horde of nearby walkers, and Rick and Carl are forced into the barn for safety. They ignite the barn after drawing walkers inside, both to draw attention and to save themselves. In the cumulative battle to save the farm, Jimmy and Patricia are killed, Andrea is left behind, and the RV is lost. Andrea attempts to survive on her own and is later rescued by a mysterious hooded person with a sword, leading chained, armless, walkers. The remaining survivors – Rick, Lori, Carl, Glenn, Daryl, Carol, T-Dog, Maggie, Beth, and Hershel – regroup on the highway but are forced to make camp due to a shortage of gas. Frustrated, Rick reveals the truth behind Shane\'s death and what Dr. Jenner whispered to him at the CDC: whatever the plague is, they all carry it and will return as walkers upon death, even if they are not bitten or scratched by a walker. A large prison looms in the distance as the season ends. -Write up taken from wikipedia site -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28season_2%29 ');
