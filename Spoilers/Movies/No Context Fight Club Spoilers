The Narrator: The narrator turns out to have split personalities. He fades in and out of being himself, and his alter ego Tyler Durden. He has been having a, mostly sexual, relationship with Marla Singer, not Tyler like he thought. He ends the movie ALIVE, but badly injured, and possibly still very much insane.

Tyler Durden: Tyler Durden is just a figment of the narrator's imagination. When the narrator shoots himself in the head, Tyler appears to have been shot in the head as well and he falls to the ground assumed DEAD.
